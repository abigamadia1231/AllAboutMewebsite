    I am a girl who codes from Dallas, Texas. I will be a junior this up-coming fall. I have 2 siblings, a brititshbulldog, and a pet fish. Iâ€™ve performed on a stage about 13 times, and I have a youtube channel where I film and edit vlogs and challenges. I film and take pictures on my FujiFilm XP 61 waterproof camera, but i am in need of a microphone for vlogging. To me, sound quality is everythig. I edit my videos on VLLO and/or Microsoft Editor. Social media, to me, isn't just an app to post pictures, social media shows off the pictures and videos that i put hardwork into. I will always have a link in my bio to my Youtube channel and I will constantly be posting pictures on instagram as well as snapchat. The first link is my first post on Youtube, a vlog.

    Another page you could visit...like the recent! I enjoy editing pictures as well! I use many apps such as VSCO and PickMonkey. I love making my own filters online, and my own graphics. I always struggle with the up-loading process. I need new software for these problems to go away. Anyways, enjoy my website!
